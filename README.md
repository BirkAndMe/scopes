# Scopes

Yet another SASS grid system.

## Get started

### Install

Download the scopes folder, and place it in the root of your scss folder.

### Use

_Take a look at the examples to learn more._

_For a very basic start look at the ```00-boilerplate``` example.._

First off import scopes and the modules you want to use into your scss. A good idea is to gather these imports into a single base import file (I usually call mine ```_base.scss```).

```sass
@import "scopes/scopes";
@import "modules/grid", "modules/variable";
```

Now setup the default grid.
